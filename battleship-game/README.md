# Battleship Game

Welcome, this project is a simple implementation of the classic naval strategy game where players try to sink each other's ships for TheOdinProject.

## How to Play
1. Each player places their ships on a grid.
2. Players take turns guessing the location of the opponent's ships.
3. If a guess hits a ship, the opponent must announce it. If it misses, the turn passes to the other player.
4. The game continues until one player sinks all of the opponent's ships.
